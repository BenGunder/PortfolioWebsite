                As an aspiring game developer, this is my favorite kind of project to be working on.
                To make my games, I have primarily used the Godot game engine in the past, but I also love trying new tools and different approaches.
                <br /><br />
                I usually work on projects like these just for fun, to experiment and learn new tools, engines, and languages, and for game jams or school projects.
                <br /><br />
                Below are the links to my game projects available on itch.io, which I hope to be adding more to in the future.
                For now, you can check out my game Flingin' Fins, a game I made for the FishFest game jam in April of 2024, available for download or playable in browser. 
                You can also view the itch.io page if you want to learn more about the game or the FishFest game jam.

                Roblox Games
            </h2>
            <br />
            <p>
                In the summer of this year, I decided that I wanted to make a game using an engine and language I had never used before.
                And so, I began a three month project of learning Lua and the Roblox Studio engine to create my game, Dungeons & Diners.
                <br /><br />
                I decided to make this game in Roblox for a few reasons. The biggest of which is that Roblox makes it incredibly easy to build multiplayer games, which is something I had never made before.
                I had also enjoyed playing a lot of other Roblox games in the past, inspiring me to make my own, and I found that Roblox Studio is incredibly approachable to new users and had extensive documentation.
                <br /><br />
                From working on this project, I learned a lot about programming multiplayer games with a client-server model. I also learned a lot about UI design and building 3D environments.
                Overall, I had a lot of fun working on this project, and I will definitely be interested in making another game in Roblox studio in the future.
                <br /><br />
                My newest project, ESCAPE POD, is a survival horror game that I released the week before Halloween. Thanks to my experience with my previous game, I was able to complete this one a lot more efficiently,
                and I think it has a lot more polish than my last. I am really proud of what I was able to do with this project and had a ton of fun making it.
                <br /><br />
                Below, you can find links to my Roblox games, which I encourage you to check out.
                My games are free to play, and you can find a Discord link on each game's page to give feedback or look at the game's development history.

                I've also done a few projects unrelated to game development through school and for fun.
                <br /><br />
                For instance, building this website was a project I began in May, 2025, and will continue developing and updating it as I work on new projects.
                You can find the <a href="https://github.com/BenGunder/PortfolioWebsite"><u>code for this website</u></a> on my Github,
                or you can use the button below to check out my GitHub page and look at my other projects as well.
